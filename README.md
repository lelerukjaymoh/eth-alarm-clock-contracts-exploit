Ethereum Alarm Clock "Exploit"

First of all this is not really an exploit (buuuut any action that enables you to get someone's else eth sounds like an exploit to me). 

So there is this package called Ethereum Alarm Clock it is a collection of smart contracts on Ethereum that aims to allow for the scheduling of transactions to be executed at a later time
The catch in these contracts is that, the contracts allows you to cancel some transaction requests even if you are not the owner. This feature is there on purpose to incentive other users to destroy the transaction requests that have "expired" and get paid for that (so its not an exploit). This is there so as to ensure funds are not forever left in these contract. 
Once you destroy someone's contract, you get paid 1% of the execution cost (bounty) that the user had set while making his transaction request plus the cost of your cancel transaction. This means that, if a a user had set the bounty (how much he is paying to have his scheduled transaction executed) as 0.1 eth, and you spend 0.0001 eth to execute the cancel transaction you should be paid (0.1 eth * 1% + 0.0001 eth) and the rest is sent to the original owner of the contract.


I saw a guy (https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xbb1d6b3be1396a4b5ccb8d061b302250bb2b73fd) who was exploiting these contracts (this guys did this for several contracts and ended up with 18 eth) and so I decided to give it a try. First started by going through the package docs (https://ethereum-alarm-clock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and saw the cancellation feature explained here (https://ethereum-alarm-clock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transaction_request.html?highlight=cancel#id11)

I created a small bot that could call the cancel function of these contracts. (https://github.com/lelerukjaymoh/eth-alarm-clock-contracts-exploit) and retrieve some eth.
Made some tests and finally it worked. I cancelled this contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0x287fd348efdef29ca03cb82554112369c9355f37) and got 0.002068 eth in this transaction (https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2bd1244aab414ba9b740b399521115612daae076dd1bbe2211335847fb2e2188). A very small amount but the experience was worth it.

Started searching for other contracts that I could exploit, got 500 of them but unfortunately all the contracts had small balances. The guy who got the 18 eth had drained most of the contracts and some had no balance at all
